DASA: File Explorer of V_TEAM
File Explorer project is used for DASA course which was taught by Prof. David
BromBerg in Pole Universite of Francaise in Vietnam. The aim of this project
is to build a le sharing and storing by leveraging on existing cloud storage
services. To do this project based on REST service, we implemented two sides,
client side and server side.
 Client side: a le explorer that explores les stored via our API.
 Server side: a REST service that provides a set of accessible resources to
manage cloud storage based les. In this project, we used Dropbox and
Google Drive.
In this project, we separate the work into two main tasks
 NGUYEN Van Phat: Implement the client side
 TRAN Nhat Quang: Implement the server side
